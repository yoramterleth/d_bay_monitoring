# discharge
various scripts looking at discharge on Sit Kusa

- the somewhat unfortunate names for the individual scripts refer to the platform they pull data from. All these scripts build timeseries of various water surface properties within a user defined area, in our case in front of the S'it' Kus'a terminus. 

- the D_Bay_turbidity.m script plots these timeseries together.
