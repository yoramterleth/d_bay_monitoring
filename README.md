# SK d_bay_monitoring

various scripts looking at discharge on Sit Kusa

- the somewhat unfortunate names for the individual scripts refer to the platform they pull data from. All these scripts build timeseries of various water surface properties within a user defined area, in our case in front of the S'it' Kus'a terminus. 

- the various earth engine scripts allow to export csv files. These can be downloaded from google drive and used with matlab. 

- the D_Bay_turbidity.m script is also a bit of a mess, but it plots these timeseries together.
